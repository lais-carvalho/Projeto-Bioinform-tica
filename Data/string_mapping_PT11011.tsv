Inhibited by the antiholin-like proteins LrgAB. In an unstressed cell, the LrgAB products probably inhibit the function of the CidAB proteins. When a cell is stressed by the addition of antibiotics or by other factors in the environment, the CidAB proteins possibly oligomerize within the bacterial cell membrane, creating lesions that disrupt the proton motive force, which in turn results in loss of cell viability. These lesions are also hypothesized to r [...]

149	thiI	176279.SERP1279	thiI	Thiamine biosynthesis protein ThiI; Catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of a sulfur to tRNA to produce 4-thiouridine in position 8 of tRNAs, which functions as a near-UV photosensor. Also catalyzes the transfer of sulfur to the sulfur carrier protein ThiS, forming ThiS-thiocarboxylate. This is a step in the synthesis of thiazole, in the thiamine biosynthesis pathway. The sulfur is donated as persulfide by IscS.
150	topA	176279.SERP0816	topA	DNA topoisomerase I; Releases the supercoiling and torsional tension of DNA, which is introduced during the DNA replication and transcription, by transiently cleaving and rejoining one strand of the DNA duplex. Introduces a single-strand break via transesterification at a target site in duplex DNA. The scissile phosphodiester is attacked by the catalytic tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA- (5'-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 3'-OH DNA strand. The free DNA strand then undergoes passage around the unbroken strand, thus removing DNA supe [...]
