Staphylococcus epidermidis with the highest percentage has the prominent role among coagulase-negative Staphylococci that is the most important reason of clinical infections. Due to various virulence factors and unique features, this microorganism is respected as a common cause of nosocomial infections. Because of potential ability in biofilm formation and colonization in different surfaces, also using of medical implant devices in immunocompromised and hospitalized patients the related infections have been increased.

	abstract = {SUMMARY
The definition of the heterogeneous group of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) is still based on diagnostic procedures that fulfill the clinical need to differentiate between Staphylococcus aureus and those staphylococci classified historically as being less or nonpathogenic. Due to patient- and procedure-related changes, CoNS now represent one of the major nosocomial pathogens, with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus being the most significant species. They account substantially for foreign body-related infections and infections in preterm newborns. While S. saprophyticus has been associated with acute urethritis, S. lugdunensis has a unique status, in some aspects resembling S. aureus in causing infectious endocarditis. In addition to CoNS found as food-associated saprophytes, many other CoNS species colonize the skin and mucous membranes of humans and animals and are less frequently involved in clinically manifested infections. This blurred gradation in terms of pathogenicity is reflected by species- and strain-specific virulence factors and the development of different host-defending strategies. Clearly, CoNS possess fewer virulence properties than S. aureus, with a respectively different disease spectrum. In this regard, host susceptibility is much more important. Therapeutically, CoNS are challenging due to the large proportion of methicillin-resistant strains and increasing numbers of isolates with less susceptibility to glycopeptides.},

	abstract = {Infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) most frequently occur after the implantation of medical devices and are attributed to the biofilm-forming potential of CoNS. Staphylococcus haemolyticus is the second most frequently isolated CoNS from patients with hospital-acquired infections. There is only limited knowledge of the nature of S. haemolyticus biofilms. The aim of this study was to characterize S. haemolyticus biofilm formation. We analyzed the biofilm-forming capacities of 72 clinical S. haemolyticus isolates. A detachment assay with NaIO4, proteinase K, or DNase was used to determine the main biofilm components. Biofilm-associated genes, including the ica operon, were analyzed by PCR, and the gene products were sequenced. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to elucidate the biofilm structure. Fifty-three isolates (74\%) produced biofilms after growth in Trypticase soy broth (TSB) with glucose, but only 22 (31\%) produced biofilms after growth in TSB with NaCl. It was necessary to dissolve the biofilm in ethanol-acetone to measure the optical density of the full biofilm mass. DNase, proteinase K, and NaIO4 caused biofilm detachment for 100\%, 98\%, and 38\% of the isolates, respectively. icaRADBC and polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production were found in only two isolates. CLSM indicated that the biofilm structure of S. haemolyticus clearly differs from that of S. epidermidis. We conclude that biofilm formation is a common phenotype in clinical S. haemolyticus isolates. In contrast to S. epidermidis, proteins and extracellular DNA are of functional relevance for biofilm accumulation, whereas PIA plays only a minor role. The induction of biofilm formation and determination of the biofilm mass also needed to be optimized for S. haemolyticus.},

	abstract = {In addition to their capacity to attach to surfaces, various groups of microorganisms also produce an extracellular polymeric substance known as "slime". This slime forms a thin layer around cells known as biofilm. Thus, biofilm structure comprises bacterial cells and an extracellular polymeric substance. It also presents a defined architecture, providing the microorganisms with an excellent protective environment and favoring the exchange of genetic material between cells as well as intercellular communication. The ability to produce biofilm is observed in a large group of bacteria, including coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) which are the predominant microorganisms of normal skin flora and have been implicated as the causative agents of hospital infections. Bacteremia caused by these agents is common in immunodepressed persons, in patients with cancer, in adult and neonatal intensive care units (ICU) and in patients using catheters or other prosthetic devices. The pathogenicity of CNS infections is probably related to the production of slime, which adheres preferentially to plastic and smooth surfaces, forming a biofilm that protects against attacks from the immune system and against antibiotic treatment, a fact hindering the eradication of these infections. The main objective of the present review was to describe basic and genetic aspects of biofilm formation and methods for its detection, with emphasis on biofilm creation by CNS and its relationship with diseases caused by these microorganisms which are becoming increasingly more frequent in the hospital environment.},

The aim of the presented study was to evaluate the prevalence of the biofilm forming coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) in a hospital environment as a risk factor for nosocomial infections. Among 122 isolated and tested strains of CoNS the most frequent were: S. epidermidis—32 strains, S. haemolyticus—31 strains, S. capitis subsp. capitis— 21 strains, S. hominis—11 strains, S. cohnii subsp. cohnii—nine strains. In case of CoNS, the main molecule responsible for intercellular adhesion is a polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), encoded on the ica gene operon. The analysis revealed the presence of the icaADBC operon genes in 46.88\% of S. epidermidis isolates. IcaA and icaD were present in 34.38\% and 28.13\% of strains respectively while IcaC gene was present in 37.50\% of strains. IcaB gene was found in 21.88\% of S. epidermidis strains. In 15 (63\%) strains all icaADBC operon genes were observed. The assessment of antibacterial drugs susceptibility demonstrated that analyzed CoNS strains were highly resistant to macrolides  and lincosamides and more sensitive to rifampicin and linezolid. Our data indicates  that the hospital environment can be colonized by biofilm forming coagulase-negative staphylococci and transmission of these strains can cause an increased risk of serious nosocomial infections.},

Isolates were tested for resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin, cefoxitin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, tigecycline, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, linezolid, trimetoprim, sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, quinupristin/dalfopristin by the disk diffusion method. PCR was used for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes encoding: methicillin resistance – mecA; macrolide resistance – erm(A), erm(B), erm(C), mrs(A/B); efflux proteins tet(K) and tet(L) and ribosomal protection proteins tet(M). For all the tet(M)-positive isolates the presence of conjugative transposons of the Tn916–Tn1545 family was determined. Most of the isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (41.3\%) followed by clindamycin (36.2\%), tigecycline (24.1\%), rifampicin (17.2\%) and erythromycin (13.8\%). 32.2\% staphylococcal isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). All methicillin resistant staphylococci harboured mecA gene. Isolates, phenotypic resistant to tetracycline, harboured at least one tetracycline resistance determinant on which tet(M) was most frequent. All of the isolates positive for tet(M) genes were positive for the Tn916–Tn1545 -like integrase family gene. In the erythromycin-resistant isolates, the macrolide resistance genes erm(C) or msr(A/B) were present. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci are not classical food poisoning bacteria, its presence in food could be of public health significance due to the possible spread of antibiotic resistance.},

More specifically genomics is the science that studies the structure, function, evolution, and mapping of genomes and aims at characterization and quantification of genes, which direct the production of proteins with the assistance of enzymes and messenger molecules. Transcriptome is the set of all messenger RNA molecules in one cell, tissue, or organism. It includes the amount or concentration of each RNA molecule in addition to the molecular identities. The term proteome refers to the sum of all the proteins in a cell, tissue, or organism. Proteomics is the science that studies those proteins as related to their biochemical properties and functional roles, and how their quantities, modifications, and structures change during growth and in response to internal and external stimuli. The metabolome represents the collection of all metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ, or organism, which are the end products of cellular processes. Metabolomics is the science that studies all chemical processes involving metabolites. More specifically, metabolomics is the study of chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes establish during their activity; it is the study of all small-molecule metabolite profiles.

The CoNS group has emerged as one of the main causes of nosocomial infections related to vascular catheters and prostheses, especially among immunocompromised patients. This gradual increase in infections is due to the change in the relationship between patients and procedures since CoNS are closely related to devices implanted in the human body. CoNS are successful in colonizing the host because they have several virulence mechanisms, such as biofilm formation and production of enzymes and toxins, in addition to several mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobials. Despite their great clinical relevance, few studies have focused on CoNS’s pathogenicity and resistance to antimicrobials, which reveals the current need to better understand the factors by which this group became pathogenic to humans and other animals.

	doi = {10.1086/501605},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) are the major cause of nosocomial bloodstream infection. Emergence of vancomycin resistance among CNS is a serious public health concern, because CNS usually are multidrug-resistant, and glycopeptide antibiotics, among which only vancomycin is available in the United States, are the only remaining effective therapy. In this report, we describe the first bloodstream infection in the United States associated with a Staphylococcus epidermidis strain with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin.
METHODS: We reviewed the hospital's microbiology records for all CNS strains, reviewed the patient's medical and laboratory records, and obtained all available CNS isolates with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin. Blood cultures were processed and CNS isolates identified by using standard methods; antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk-diffusion methods. Nares cultures were obtained from exposed healthcare workers (HCWs) to identify possible colonization by CNS with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin.
RESULTS: The bloodstream infection by an S. epidermidis strain with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin occurred in a 49-year-old woman with carcinoma. She had two blood cultures positive for CNS; both isolates were S. epidermidis. Although susceptible to vancomycin by the disk-diffusion method (16-17 mm), the isolates were intermediate by MIC (8-6 microg/mL). The patient had received an extended course of vancomycin therapy; she died of her underlying disease. No HCW was colonized by CNS with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report in the United States of bloodstream infection due to S. epidermidis with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin. Contact precautions likely played a role in preventing nosocomial transmission of this strain, and disk-diffusion methods may be inadequate to detect CNS with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin.},

The size of the inoculum had a marked effect on the minimal inhibitory concentrations and the minimal bactericidal concentrations of all three antibiotics. With a small inoculum, 100\% of the isolates were inhibited by 3.12 micrograms of vancomycin/ml, 76\% by 12.5 micrograms of cephalothin/ml, and 64\% by 12.5 micrograms of cefazolin/ml. With a large inoculum 100\% of the isolates were inhibited by 200 micrograms of vancomycin/ml, 40\% by 12.5 micrograms of cephalothin/ml, and 12\% by 12.5 micrograms of cefazolin/ml. As determined by a tube dilution checkerboard technique for both sizes of inoculum, the combination of vancomycin plus cephalothin was synergistic against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis in 45 of 50 cases, and the combination of vancomycin plus cefazolin was synergistic in 39 or 50 cases. These data from in vitro studies suggest that these antibiotic combinations should be evaluated clinically in patients with severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis.},

Endocarditis tended to affect the elderly population and the clinical manifestations were quite similar to those caused by Streptococcus viridans. Both patients with osteomyelitis had involvement of the cervical spine with excellent response to antibiotic therapy. The only patient with septicemia acquired via hyperalimentation had delayed clearance of the bacteremia but ultimately responded to intravenous antibiotics. Rifampicin was the most effective of all antibiotics tested. All isolates were sensitive to penicillinase-resistant penicillins and cephalosporins and over half were sensitive to penicillin. Full synergistic activity was demonstrated with cephalothin and nafcillin in combination with rifampicin, and rifampicin-vancomycin was partially synergistic against the majority of the strains. Five of 8 available isolates were non-phage typeable and no definite pattern was established for various types of infections.

We implemented a pipeline to remove redundant highly similar proteomes that were causing excessive redundancy in UniProt. The initial run of this pipeline reduced the number of sequences in UniProt by 47 million. For our users interested in the accessory proteomes, we have made available sets of pan proteome sequences that cover the diversity of sequences for each species that is found in its strains and sub-strains. To help interpretation of genomic variants, we provide tracks of detailed protein information for the major genome browsers. We provide a SPARQL endpoint that allows complex queries of the more than 22 billion triples of data in UniProt (http://sparql.uniprot.org/).

The ultimate target was to search for non-host proteins followed by their essentiality in survival and subsequent involvement in unique bacterial pathways. The shortlisted 27 proteins in 11 unique pathways were later characterized for druggable potential. Total 15 cytoplasmic targets were selected from the previous set and were further characterized on the basis of known 3D structures and high percentage coverage and increased percentage sequence identity, in case of unknown experimental structures. Only cell division protein ftsZ was retrieved to have resolved 3D structure. Proteins with high coverage and increased sequence identity were alanine racemase, d-alanine-d-alanine ligase, tRNA dimethylallyltransferase, phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase and response regulator protein vraR. The highly specific proteins screened out in our study, will presumably accelerate the unraveling of novel therapeutic drugs against S. epidermidis.},

With the increased rate of emerging resistant and previously undefined infectious diseases, there is a growing need to develop a novel vaccine possessing required immunogenic properties. The adopted reverse vaccinology approach identified “IMPNQILTI” of LysM domain protein, “YSYTYTIDA” of staphylococcal secretory antigen SsaA, and “YNYDANTGQ” neutral metalloproteinaseas potential peptides for vaccine design. The 9-mer epitope of target proteins is antigenic, virulent, surface-exposed, non-allergenic, and conserved across various strains of S. epidermidis. Protein-protein interactions study indicated the involvement of target proteins in major biological pathways for S. epidermidis pathogenesis. Protein-peptide docking was performed, and population coverage analysis showed significant interactions of T-cell epitopes with the HLA-binding molecules while covering 90.58\% of the world's population. Further, a multi-epitope vaccine of 177 amino acids long was constructed. Docking with Toll-like receptor (TLR-2) molecule confirmed the effective interaction of the vaccine with the receptor. The vaccine efficiency in generating an effective immune response in the host was evaluated by immune simulation. Finally, in silico cloning confirmed that the constructed vaccine can be efficiently expressed in E. coli. However, the designed vaccine needs experimental validation to determine the effectiveness and immunogenicity profile, which will ensure an active immunity against S. epidermidis.},

In this work, we compared the proteomes of planktonic vs biofilm cells from a clinical strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis using LC-MS/MS. A total of 168 proteins were identified from both growth conditions. The biofilm cells showed enrichment of proteins participating in glycolysis for the formation of pyruvate; however, the absence of TCA cycle proteins and the presence of lactate dehydrogenase, formate acetyltransferase, and acetoin reductase suggested that pyruvate was catabolized to their respective products: lactate, formate and acetoin. On the other hand, planktonic cells showed proteins participating in glycolysis and the TCA cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, gluconeogenesis, ATP generation and the oxidative stress response. Functional networks with higher interconnection were predicted for planktonic proteins. We propose that in S. epidermidis, the relative absence of TCA cycle proteins is associated with the formation of biofilms and that lactate, formate and acetoin are the end products of partial glucose metabolism.},

The community-acquired SCC{\textless}italic{\textgreater}mec{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} type IV was the most common SCC{\textless}italic{\textgreater}mec{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} type. The CoNS belonged to seven multilocus sequence types (MLSTs) and carried a diversity of mobile genetic elements such as phages, insertion sequences, and plasmids. The bacterial anti-phage defense systems clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated (CRISPR-Cas) immunity phage system and restriction-modification system (R-M system) and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME) involved in immune evasion and transport of virulence genes were also found. The insertion sequence, IS256, linked with virulence, was found in 56.3\% of isolates. Generally, the isolates clustered according to STs, with some similarity but also considerable variability within isolates. Whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis provide insights into the likely pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}S. epidermidis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, necessitating surveillance of this emerging pathogen.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogen associated with community-acquired and healthcare-associated infections, and is known for rapid acquisition of resistance to multiple antibiotics. Staphylococcus epidermidis is another staphylococcal species commonly seen as a commensal, but may cause opportunistic infections. These two closely related species may naturally co-colonize and inhabit the human skin and nose; thus it is important to develop methods to differentiate between them. Conventional differentiation methods (e.g., mannitol salt agar, coagulase test, Analytical Profile Index kits) require culturing and isolating the bacteria, while molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or sequencing are culture independent, highly accurate, and sensitive. They may be objectively interpreted and can be adapted for high-throughput assays. Here, we aimed to develop a rapid and accurate method to differentiate mixtures of S.\&amp;nbsp;aureus and S.\&amp;nbsp;epidermidis in clinical isolates and microbiome samples. Using comparative genomics tools (e.g., MetaRef and PATRIC bioinformatics resource center), we compared the core and pan genomes of S.\&amp;nbsp;aureus and S.\&amp;nbsp;epidermidis to determine signature genes for each species. Among candidate genes, we chose the virulence genes, staphostatin\&amp;nbsp;B and staphostatin\&amp;nbsp;A as genetic biomarkers for S.\&amp;nbsp;aureus and S.\&amp;nbsp;epidermidis, respectively. We designed PCR primers that target specific sequences within each gene and tested them on DNA isolated from laboratory strains, clinical isolates, nasal isolates, and nasal swabs. Our developed method is simple, specific, sensitive, and can be applied to metagenomic samples as well as competition or co-evolution studies in which the two organisms are co-cultured.},

There is an essential need to develop novel drug targets to address the new intervention challenge for such multidrug-resistant bacteria. Here we utilized the available genomes and proteome datasets resources of MRSE S. epidermidis RP62A for comparative and subtractive genome analyses to identify novel drug targets for future drug discovery approaches. The comparative genome based molecular biology database resources scanning identified 255 proteins as essential human non-homologs targets for epidermidis RP62A that involve in essential metabolic pathways. Among these 12 targets were found to be involved in pathogen unique metabolic pathways. Druggability potential of each of these targets by Drug Bank database further identified 5 proteins as druggable essential proteins. As antimicrobial agents inflict beneficial gut microbiome and the antibiotics causes less agitation in gut flora are considered as best candidates. We pursued additional analysis and screen our lead targets proteins against metagenomes databases holding whole genome sequences of human gut microbiome. The negligible biological similarity with gut microbiota genomes datasets predicting the future implementation of our lead identified proteins as druggable targets for S. epidermidis RP62A that may not affect the essential humans gut microbiota. Based on these evidences, we are speculating that the putative druggable proteins addressed in this study are potent enough for their future evaluation as therapeutic targets to combat the S. epidermidis RP62A infections.},

Far less studied than Staphylococcus aureus, the mechanisms behind this increasingly recognised pathogenicity are yet to be fully understood. Improving our knowledge of the metabolic processes that allow S. epidermidis to colonise different body sites is key to defining its pathogenic potential. Thus, we have constructed a fully curated, genome-scale metabolic model for S. epidermidis RP62A, and investigated its metabolic properties with a focus on substrate auxotrophies and its utilisation for energy and biomass production. Our results show that, although glucose is available in the medium, only a small portion of it enters the glycolytic pathways, whils most is utilised for the production of biofilm, storage and the structural components of biomass. Amino acids, proline, valine, alanine, glutamate and arginine, are preferred sources of energy and biomass production. In contrast to previous studies, we have shown that this strain has no real substrate auxotrophies, although removal of proline from the media has the highest impact on the model and the experimental growth characteristics. Further study is needed to determine the significance of proline, an abundant amino acid in collagen, in S. epidermidis colonisation.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus epidermidis, a commensal bacterium inhabiting collagen-rich areas, like human skin, has gained significance due to its probiotic potential in the nasal microbiome and as a leading cause of nosocomial infections. While infrequently leading to severe illnesses, S. epidermidis exerts a significant influence, particularly in its close association with implant-related infections and its role as a classic opportunistic biofilm former. Understanding its opportunistic nature is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies, addressing both its beneficial and pathogenic aspects, and alleviating the burdens it imposes on patients and healthcare systems. Here, we employ genome-scale metabolic modeling as a powerful tool to elucidate the lifestyle and capabilities of S. epidermidis. We created a comprehensive computational resource for understanding the organism’s growth conditions within diverse habitats by reconstructing and analyzing a manually curated and experimentally validated metabolic model. The final network, iSep23, incorporates 1,415 reactions, 1,051 metabolites, and 705 genes, adhering to established community standards and modeling guidelines. Benchmarking with the MEMOTE test suite yields a high score, highlighting the model’s high semantic quality. Following the FAIR data principles, iSep23 becomes a valuable and publicly accessible asset for subsequent studies. Growth simulations and carbon source utilization predictions align with experimental results, showcasing the model’s predictive power. This metabolic model advances our understanding of S. epidermidis as a commensal and potential probiotic and enhances insights into its opportunistic pathogenicity against other microorganisms.
Author summary Staphylococcus epidermidis, a bacterium commonly found on human skin, has shown probiotic effects in the nasal microbiome and is a notable causative agent of hospital-acquired infections. While typically causing non-life-threatening diseases, the economic ramifications of S. epidermidis infections are substantial, with annual costs reaching billions of dollars in the United States. To unravel its opportunistic nature, we utilized genome-scale metabolic modeling, creating a detailed mathematical network that elucidates S. epidermidis’s lifestyle and capabilities. This model, encompassing over a thousand reactions, metabolites, and genes, adheres rigorously to established standards and guidelines, evident in its commendable benchmarking scores. Adhering to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), the model stands as a valuable resource for subsequent investigations. Growth simulations and predictions align closely with experimental results, showcasing the model’s predictive accuracy. This metabolic model not only enhances our understanding of S. epidermidis as a skin commensal and potential probiotic but also sheds light on its opportunistic pathogenicity, particularly in competition with other microorganisms.},

Predefined gene sets may be genes in a known metabolic pathway, located in the same cytogenetic band, sharing the same Gene Ontology category, or any user-defined set. In microarray experiments where no single gene shows statistically significant differential expression between phenotypes, GSEA has identified significant differentially expressed sets of genes, even where the average difference in expression between two phenotypes is only 20\% for genes in the gene set. The gene set identified in the first GSEA analysis (oxidative phosphorylation genes differentially expressed in diabetic versus non-diabetic patients) was subsequently confirmed by independent laboratory studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Since the first paper on GSEA was published, many extensions and alternative methods have been described in the literature. In this paper, we describe the original GSEA algorithm, subsequent extensions and alternatives, results of some of the applications, some limitations of the methods and caveats for users, and possible future research directions. GSEA and related methods are complementary to conventional single-gene methods. Single gene methods work best when individual genes have large effects and there is small variance within the phenotype. GSEA is likely to be more powerful than conventional single-gene methods for studying the large number of common diseases in which many genes each make subtle contributions.

To highlight the relation between transcripts and proteins of S. epidermidis biofilms, we analyzed the proteomic profile obtained by two mechanical lysis methods (sonication and bead beating), associated with two distinct detergent extraction buffers, namely SDS and CHAPS. Based on gel electrophoresis-LC–MS/MS, we identified a total of 453 proteins. While lysis with glass beads provided greater amounts of protein, CHAPS extraction buffer allowed identification of a higher number of proteins compared to SDS. Our data shows the impact of different protein isolation methods in the characterization of the S. epidermidis biofilm proteome.

Previously, we have shown that S. epidermidis biofilms with higher proportions of dormant bacteria have reduced activation of murine macrophages. RNA-sequencing was used to identify the major transcriptomic differences between S. epidermidis biofilms with different proportions of dormant bacteria. To accomplish this goal, we used an in vitro model where magnesium allowed modulation of the proportion of dormant bacteria within S. epidermidis biofilms. Significant differences were found in the expression of 147 genes. A detailed analysis of the results was performed based on direct and functional gene interactions. Biological processes among the differentially expressed genes were mainly related to oxidation-reduction processes and acetyl-CoA metabolic processes. Gene set enrichment revealed that the translation process is related to the proportion of dormant bacteria. Transcription of mRNAs involved in oxidation-reduction processes was associated with higher proportions of dormant bacteria within S. epidermidis biofilm. Moreover, the pH of the culture medium did not change after the addition of magnesium, and genes related to magnesium transport did not seem to impact entrance of bacterial cells into dormancy.},

	abstract = {Staphylococcus epidermidis is a ubiquitous human commensal skin bacterium that is also one of the most prevalent nosocomial pathogens. The genetic factors underlying this remarkable lifestyle plasticity are incompletely understood, mainly due to the difficulties of genetic manipulation, precluding high-throughput functional profiling of this species. To probe the versatility of S. epidermidis to survive across a diversity of environmental conditions, we developed a large-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen complemented by transcriptional profiling (RNA sequencing) across 24 diverse conditions and piloted a droplet-based CRISPRi approach to enhance throughput and sensitivity. We identified putative essential genes, importantly revealing amino acid metabolism as crucial to survival across diverse environments, and demonstrated the importance of trace metal uptake for survival under multiple stress conditions. We identified pathways significantly enriched and repressed across our range of stress and nutrient-limited conditions, demonstrating the considerable plasticity of S. epidermidis in responding to environmental stressors. Additionally, we postulate a mechanism by which nitrogen metabolism is linked to lifestyle versatility in response to hyperosmotic challenges, such as those encountered on human skin. Finally, we examined the survival of S. epidermidis under acid stress and hypothesize a role for cell wall modification as a vital component of the survival response under acidic conditions. Taken together, this study integrates large-scale CRISPRi and transcriptomics data across multiple environments to provide insights into a keystone member of the human skin microbiome. Our results additionally provide a valuable benchmarking analysis for CRISPRi screens and are a rich resource for other staphylococcal researchers.
IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus epidermidis is a bacteria that broadly inhabits healthy human skin, yet it is also a common cause of skin infections and bloodstream infections associated with implanted medical devices. Because human skin has many different types of S. epidermidis, each containing different genes, our goal is to determine how these different genes allow S. epidermidis to switch from healthy growth in the skin to being an infectious pathogen. Understanding this switch is critical to developing new strategies to prevent and treat S. epidermidis infections.},

Eighty-five CoNS strains, obtained from 198 RTE food samples, were investigated. Sixty-seven CoNS isolates (78.8\%) were resistant to at least one antibiotic tested, and 37 (43.5\%) were multidrug resistant (MDR-CoNS). Moreover, CoNS strains contained genes conferring resistance to antibiotics critically important in medicine, i.e., β—lactams [mecA (29.4\%); blaZ (84.7\%)], aminoglycosides [aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia (45.9\%); aph(2″)-Ic (3.5\%)], macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin B-MLSB [msrA/B (68.2\%); ermB (40\%) and mphC (4.7\%)], tetracyclines [tetK (31.8\%); tetM (16.5\%) and/or tetL (2.35\%)]. We also found the fusB/C/D genes responsible for the acquired low-level fusidic acid resistance (17.6\%) and streptogramin resistance determinant vgaA in 30.6\% of isolates. In three linezolid resistant strains (2 S. epidermidis and 1 S. warneri), mutation was detected, as demonstrated by L101V and V188I changes in the L3 protein amino acid sequences. The high frequency in RTE food of MDR-CoNS including methicillin-resistant (MR-CoNS) strains constitutes a direct risk to public health as they increase the gene pool from which pathogenic bacteria can pick up resistance traits.},

We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

Typical experimental design consists in comparing two conditions with several replicates using a differential gene expression test followed by preranked GSEA performed against a collection of hundreds and thousands of pathways. However, the reference implementation of this method cannot accurately estimate small P-values, which significantly limits its sensitivity due to multiple hypotheses correction procedure.
Here we present FGSEA (Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) method that is able to estimate arbitrarily low GSEA P-values with a high accuracy in a matter of minutes or even seconds. To confirm the accuracy of the method, we also developed an exact algorithm for GSEA P-values calculation for integer gene-level statistics. Using the exact algorithm as a reference we show that FGSEA is able to routinely estimate P-values up to 10−100 with a small and predictable estimation error. We systematically evaluate FGSEA on a collection of 605 datasets and show that FGSEA recovers much more statistically significant pathways compared to other implementations.

However, conventional methods for pathway analysis do not take into account complex protein-protein interaction information, resulting in incomplete conclusions. Previously, numerous approaches that utilize protein-protein interaction information to enhance pathway analysis yielded superior results compared to conventional methods. Hereby, we present pathfindR, another approach exploiting protein-protein interaction information and the first R package for active-subnetwork-oriented pathway enrichment analyses for class comparison omics experiments. Using the list of genes obtained from an omics experiment comparing two groups of samples, pathfindR identifies active subnetworks in a protein-protein interaction network. It then performs pathway enrichment analyses on these identified subnetworks. To further reduce the complexity, it provides functionality for clustering the resulting pathways. Moreover, through a scoring function, the overall activity of each pathway in each sample can be estimated. We illustrate the capabilities of our pathway analysis method on three gene expression datasets and compare our results with those obtained from three popular pathway analysis tools. The results demonstrate that literature-supported disease-related pathways ranked higher in our approach compared to the others. Moreover, pathfindR identified additional pathways relevant to the conditions that were not identified by other tools, including pathways named after the conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To overcome this limitation, we developed a GSEA package in Python (GSEApy), which could efficiently analyze large single-cell datasets.We present a package (GSEApy) that performs GSEA in either the command line or Python environment. GSEApy uses a Rust implementation to enable it to calculate the same enrichment statistic as GSEA for a collection of pathways.

GSEApy also provides an interface between Python and Enrichr web services, as well as for BioMart. The Enrichr application programming interface enables GSEApy to perform over-representation analysis for an input gene list.

To promote their own survival, bacteria have to rapidly adapt to external perturbations by inducing particular stress responses that typically involve genetic and/or cellular changes. In addition, pathogenic bacteria need to sense and withstand these environmental stresses within a host to establish and maintain infection. These responses can be, in principle, induced by changes in bacterial cell structure, metabolism and group behavior. Bacterial nucleic acids may serve as the core part of the stress response, and the cell envelope and ribosomes protect genetic structures from damage. Cellular metabolism and group behavior, such as quorum sensing system, can play a more important role in resisting stress than we have now found. Since bacteria survival can be only appreciated if we better understand the mechanisms behind bacterial stress response, here we review how morphological and physiological features may lead to bacterial resistance upon exposure to particular stress-inducing factors.},

However, multi-drug-resistant bacteria alter their plasma membrane (PM) lipids, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and phospholipids (PLs), to evade membrane-targeted antibiotics. Investigations reveal that in addition to LPS, the varying composition and spatiotemporal organization of PLs in the bacterial PM are currently being explored as novel drug targets. Additionally, PM proteins such as Mla complex, MPRF, Lpts, lipid II flippase, PL synthases, and PL flippases that maintain PM integrity are the most sought-after targets for development of new-generation drugs. However, most of their structural details and mechanism of action remains elusive. Exploration of the role of bacterial membrane lipidome and proteome in addition to their organization is the key to developing novel membrane-targeted antibiotics. In addition, membranotropic phytochemicals and their synthetic derivatives have gained attractiveness as popular herbal alternatives against bacterial multi-drug resistance.

	abstract = {RsaE is a conserved small regulatory RNA (sRNA) which was previously reported to represent a riboregulator of central carbon flow and other metabolic pathways in Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Here we show that RsaE contributes to extracellular (e)DNA release and biofilm-matrix switching towards polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) production in a hypervariable Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate. Transcriptome analysis through differential RNA sequencing (dRNA-seq) in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and reporter gene fusions demonstrate that S. epidermidis protein- and PIA-biofilm matrix producers differ with respect to RsaE and metabolic gene expression. RsaE is spatiotemporally expressed within S. epidermidis PIA-mediated biofilms, and its overexpression triggers a PIA biofilm phenotype as well as eDNA release in an S. epidermidis protein biofilm matrix-producing strain background. dRNA-seq and Northern blot analyses revealed RsaE to exist as a major full-length 100-nt transcript and a minor processed species lacking approximately 20 nucleotides at the 5'-end. RsaE processing results in expansion of the mRNA target spectrum. Thus, full-length RsaE interacts with S. epidermidis antiholin-encoding lrgA mRNA, facilitating bacterial lysis and eDNA release. Processed RsaE, however, interacts with the 5'-UTR of icaR and sucCD mRNAs, encoding the icaADBC biofilm operon repressor IcaR and succinyl-CoA synthetase of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, respectively. RsaE augments PIA-mediated biofilm matrix production, most likely through activation of icaADBC operon expression via repression of icaR as well as by TCA cycle inhibition and re-programming of staphylococcal central carbon metabolism towards PIA precursor synthesis. Additionally, RsaE supports biofilm formation by mediating the release of eDNA as stabilizing biofilm matrix component. As RsaE itself is heterogeneously expressed within biofilms, we consider this sRNA to function as a factor favoring phenotypic heterogeneity and supporting division of labor in S. epidermidis biofilm communities.},

Biofilm assembly is significantly fostered by production of a bacteria derived extracellular matrix. However, the matrix composition, spatial organization, and relevance of specific molecular interactions for integration of bacterial cells into the multilayered biofilm community are not fully understood. Here we report on the function of novel 18 kDa Small basic protein (Sbp) that was isolated from S. epidermidis biofilm matrix preparations by an affinity chromatographic approach. Sbp accumulates within the biofilm matrix, being preferentially deposited at the biofilm–substratum interface. Analysis of Sbp-negative S. epidermidis mutants demonstrated the importance of Sbp for sustained colonization of abiotic surfaces, but also epithelial cells. In addition, Sbp promotes assembly of S. epidermidis cell aggregates and establishment of multilayered biofilms by influencing polysaccharide intercellular-adhesin (PIA) and accumulation associated protein (Aap) mediated intercellular aggregation. While inactivation of Sbp indirectly resulted in reduced PIA-synthesis and biofilm formation, Sbp serves as an essential ligand during Aap domain-B mediated biofilm accumulation. Our data support the conclusion that Sbp serves as an S. epidermidis biofilm scaffold protein that significantly contributes to key steps of surface colonization. Sbp-negative S. epidermidis mutants showed no attenuated virulence in a mouse catheter infection model. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of sbp in commensal and invasive S. epidermidis populations suggests that Sbp plays a significant role as a co-factor during both multi-factorial commensal colonization and infection of artificial surfaces.},

The emergence of S. epidermidis as an opportunistic pathogen is closely linked to the biofilm forming capability of the species. During the past decades, tremendous advance regarding our understanding of molecular mechanisms contributing to surface colonization has been made, and detailed information is available for several factors active during the primary attachment, accumulative or dispersal phase of biofilm formation. A picture evolved in which distinct factors, though appearing to be redundantly organized, take over specific and exclusive functions during biofilm development. In this review, these mechanisms are described in molecular detail, with a highlight on recent insights into multi-functional S. epidermidis cell surface proteins contributing to surface adherence and intercellular adhesion. The integration of distinct biofilm-promoting factors into regulatory networks is summarized, with an emphasis on mechanism that could allow S. epidermidis to flexibly adapt to changing environmental conditions present during colonizing or invasive life-styles.},

	abstract = {Previous work suggests that altered lipid metabolism may be associated with daptomycin resistance in Gram-positive pathogens, but lipidomic changes underlying resistance are not fully understood. We performed untargeted lipidomics by using three-dimensional hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (HILIC-IM-MS) to characterize alterations in the lipidomes of daptomycin-susceptible and -resistant isogenic strain pairs of Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Corynebacterium striatum. We first validated the HILIC-IM-MS method by replicating the expected alterations of phospholipid metabolism in the previously studied E. faecalis strain pairs, such as reduced phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), while also revealing additional changes in cardiolipins (CLs), lysyl-PGs, and glycolipids. Whole-genome sequencing of the S. aureus and C. striatum strains found that daptomycin resistance was associated with mutations in pgsA, which encodes phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, as well as mutations in genes affecting fatty acid biosynthesis and cell wall metabolism. Lipidomics revealed significantly decreased levels of PGs, CLs, and amino acid-modified PGs, as well as accumulation of lipids upstream of PGs, such as glycolipids and phosphatidic acids, in the resistant strains. Notably, the glycolipids, diglucosyldiacylglycerols, were significantly elevated in a fatty acid-dependent manner in the daptomycin-resistant S. aureus strain. In daptomycin-resistant C. striatum, which has a unique cell envelope architecture, the glycolipids, glucuronosyldiacylglycerols, and phosphatidylinositols were significantly elevated. These results demonstrate that alteration of lipid metabolism via mutations in pgsA is a common mechanism of daptomycin resistance in two distinct species of Gram-positive bacteria and point to the potential contribution of altered glycolipid and fatty acid compositions to daptomycin resistance.IMPORTANCE This work comprehensively characterizes lipidomic changes underlying daptomycin resistance in three Gram-positive bacterial species, E. faecalis, S. aureus, and C. striatum, by using a novel three-dimensional lipidomics methodology based on advanced mass spectrometry. We demonstrated a number of advantages of our method in comparison with other methods commonly used in the field, such as high molecular specificity, sensitivity, and throughput. Whole-genome sequencing of the S. aureus and C. striatum strains identified mutations in pgsA, which encodes phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase, in both resistant strains. Lipidomics revealed significantly decreased levels of lipids downstream of PgsA, as well as accumulation of lipids upstream of PgsA in the resistant strains. Furthermore, we found that changes in individual molecular species of each lipid class depend on the their specific fatty acid compositions. The characteristic changes in individual lipid species could be used as biomarkers for identifying underlying resistance mechanisms and for evaluating potential therapies.},

The histidine protein kinase, which is regulated by environmental stimuli, autophosphorylates at a histidine residue, creating a high-energy phosphoryl group that is subsequently transferred to an aspartate residue in the response regulator protein. Phosphorylation induces a conformational change in the regulatory domain that results in activation of an associated domain that effects the response. The basic scheme is highly adaptable, and numerous variations have provided optimization within specific signaling systems. The domains of two-component proteins are modular and can be integrated into proteins and pathways in a variety of ways, but the core structures and activities are maintained.

As in higher organisms, the information supplied by these molecules is critical for synchronizing the activities of large groups of cells. In bacteria, chemical communication involves producing, releasing, detecting, and responding to small hormone-like molecules termed autoinducers . This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacteria to monitor the environment for other bacteria and to alter behavior on a population-wide scale in response to changes in the number and/or species present in a community. Most quorum-sensing-controlled processes are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium acting alone but become beneficial when carried out simultaneously by a large number of cells. Thus, quorum sensing confuses the distinction between prokaryotes and eukaryotes because it enables bacteria to act as multicellular organisms. This review focuses on the architectures of bacterial chemical communication networks; how chemical information is integrated, processed, and transduced to control gene expression; how intra- and interspecies cell-cell communication is accomplished; and the intriguing possibility of prokaryote-eukaryote cross-communication.},

In contrast to Staphylococcus aureus, virulence properties associated with S. epidermidis are few and biofilm formation is the defining virulence factor associated with disease, as demonstrated by animal models of biomaterial-related infections. However, other virulence factors, such as phenol-soluble modulins and poly-γ-DL-glutamic acid, have been recently recognized that thwart innate immune system mechanisms. Formation of S. epidermidis biofilm is typically considered a four-step process consisting of adherence, accumulation, maturation and dispersal. This article will discuss recent advances in the study of these four steps, including accumulation, which can be either polysaccharide or protein mediated. It is hypothesized that studies focused on understanding the biological function of each step in staphylococcal biofilm formation will yield new treatment modalities to treat these recalcitrant infections.},

	abstract = {Charge matters! The charge state significantly influences the conformation and the binding energy between vancomycin antibiotic and bacterial cell-wall analogue peptides (see figure). Surface-induced dissociation (SID) studies provide a quantitative comparison between the stabilities of different charge states of the complex.In this study we examined the effect of the charge state on the energetics and dynamics of dissociation of the noncovalent complex between the vancomycin and the cell-wall peptide analogue N(alpha),N(epsilon)-diacetyl-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala (V-Ac(2)LKdAdA). The binding energies between the vancomycin and the peptide were obtained from the RRKM (Rice, Ramsperger, Kassel, Marcus) modeling of the time- and energy-resolved surface-induced dissociation (SID) experiments. Our results demonstrate that the stability of the complex towards fragmentation increases in the order: doubly protonated{\textless}singly protonated{\textless}deprotonated. Dissociation of the singly protonated and singly deprotonated complex is characterized by very large entropy effects, which indicate a substantial increase in the conformational flexibility of the resulting products. The experimental threshold energies of (1.75+/-0.08) eV ((40.3+/-1.8) kcal mol(-1)) and (1.34+/-0.08) eV ((30.9+/-1.8) kcal mol(-1)) obtained for the deprotonated and singly protonated complexes, respectively, are in excellent agreement with the results of density functional theory calculations. The increased stability of the deprotonated complex observed experimentally is attributed to the presence of three charged sites in the deprotonated complex, as compared with only one charged site in the singly protonated complex. The low binding energy of (0.93+/-0.04) eV ((21.4+/-0.9) kcal mol(-1)) obtained for the doubly protonated complex suggests that this ion is destabilized by Coulomb repulsion between the singly protonated vancomycin and the singly protonated peptide comprising the complex.},

	abstract = {Cathelicidin LL-37 is one of the few human bactericidal peptides with potent antistaphylococcal activity. In this study we examined the susceptibility of LL-37 to proteolytic degradation by two major proteinases produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a metalloproteinase (aureolysin) and a glutamylendopeptidase (V8 protease). We found that aureolysin cleaved and inactivated LL-37 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of the generated fragments by mass spectroscopy revealed that the initial cleavage of LL-37 by aureolysin occurred between the Arg19-Ile20, Arg23-Ile24, and Leu31-Val32 peptide bonds, instantly annihilating the antibacterial activity of LL-37. In contrast, the V8 proteinase hydrolyzed efficiently only the Glu16-Phe17 peptide bond, rendering the C-terminal fragment refractory to further degradation. This fragment (termed LL-17-37) displayed antibacterial activity against S. aureus at a molar level similar to that of the full-length LL-37 peptide, indicating that the antibacterial activity of LL-37 resides in the C-terminal region. In keeping with LL-37 degradation by aureolysin, S. aureus strains that produce significant amounts of this metalloprotease were found to be less susceptible to LL-17-37 than strains expressing no aureolysin activity. Taken together, these data suggest that aureolysin production by S. aureus contributes to the resistance of this pathogen to the innate immune system of humans mediated by LL-37.},
